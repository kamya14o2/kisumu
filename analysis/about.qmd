My name is [Kamya Khandelwal](www.linkedin.com/in/kamya-khandelwal) (bottom) and I am a City Planning student with Urban Design focus from the University of Pennsylvania, and three years experience in urban development and community engagement. I am looking forward to applying design and planning skills for transformative projects.

I have created this project using Python, rendering on Quarto and published through Github pages.
