# Analysis 

I am using scikit-learn for k-means clustering to classify Landsat 8 imagery for understanding urban landscapes in Kisumu. Then, I applied OSMnx for street network analysis in Kisumu to evaluate urban walkability, focusing on factors like street density and accessibility to amenities. This approach allowed me to assess the relationship between urban form and walkability in Kisumu.
